# ABM-Survey

The purpose of this repository is to compile a collection of existing and functioning agent-based models (ABMs) to provide insights and frameworks for future ABM models. 

The following methods of assessment are conducted in order to gauge overall effectivness of the compiled ABMs.
  1. Popularity: Citations/usage/downloads
  2. Flexibility: Single/Multi-virus, hard-coded/flexible states, fixed/arbitrary policies, mutating variants, etc.
  3. Efficiency (speed): Measured in millions of individuals/second.
  4. Scale: Size measured in the number of individuals.
  5. Other features: Spatial locations, transportation (contagion while moving,)
